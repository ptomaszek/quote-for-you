TODO:
 - fetch 10 quotes to assert new ones will be shown when offline
 - keep a bucket of 10 new quotes in local storage
 - remember ids of 10 last quotes to avoid duplicates (maybe this has no sense and the check could become a performance issue)
 - allow user to see last 10 quotes
 - About link - popup referencing forismatic.com
 - background images as an option
